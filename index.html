            <h2>A true creative stuck in a complicated world</h2>
            <p>My name is Daniel, but everyone calls me DMAC. I've been passionate about art my whole life, especially music and digital media. Skateboarding was a huge part of my upbringing, and it gave me a unique perspective on the world, both architecturally and socially. Being immersed in authentic communities naturally led me to 90s hip-hop and record collecting. I fell in love with hip-hop production, spending most of my years honing my skills with the MPC and writing music.</p>
            <p>Throughout all of this, I've always been deeply engaged in my other interests. I've been involved in competitive esports, ran a lucrative vape coil company, built several custom computers, and developed websites and tools for friends in different walks of life. I like to keep myself busy and love diving deep into competency hierarchies. I'm not someone who can be casual in anything I do.</p>

            <h3>Crafting digital journeys with purpose</h3>
            <p>I have over a decade of professional web development experience, specializing in PHP CMS solutions, including Drupal and WordPress development. I have a strong background in backend web development, with expertise in site building, API integrations, and plugin development. My experience spans building custom membership systems, MVC frameworks, developing proprietary CMS functionalities, and retrofitting web properties with enhanced features.</p>
            <p>As a Google Partner for five years, I solely maintained the annual Google Ads Search, Display, and Video marketing certifications and managed an effective 90-day ad spend of $10,000 USD across various industries with continuous monitoring, reporting, and optimizations towards client goals in several different industries such as higher education, industrial construction, and fine arts to name a few. </p>
            <p>I also specialize in setting up and optimizing conversion pipelines, GTM tag installation and testing, Google analytics configurations, landing page development, long-term PPC management, and insightful reporting solutions. I have a strong grasp of audience targeting using SEM tools and have successfully implemented SEO strategies based on competitive research, localized search trends, and both on-page and off-page optimizations.</p>
            <p>I bring experience across the entire digital marketing lifecycle, from gathering requirements and building web solutions to crafting strategies that drive success. My strength lies in helping people turn nothing into something meaningful.</p>

            <h3>I want to work with cool smart people</h3>
            <p>I am currently seeking part-time or full-time remote work across any industry, but I am also open to hybrid options. I'm not necessarily opposed to roles outside of my current expertise eitherâ€”working with a marketing agency for a long time across a broad spectrum of industries has really opened my eyes to how the world operates, and has peaked my interest in many ways. I have a passion for teaching what I know, learning from others, and collaborating to create effective solutions to problems.</p>

                                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The union sought to enhance functionality for member job applications, travel card registrations, and membership verification to improve the online dispatch process.</p>
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a custom union dispatch system in Drupal 7 with features for member verification, streamlined travel card registration, and automated job posting management.</p>

                                <h3>Online Dispatch Portal and Member Management System</h3>

                                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Local 488 sought to enhance operational efficiency by allowing members, permit holders, and travel card holders to create accounts on their website, local488.ca. This would provide secure access to information from the Union Manager system. However, the existing process lacked secure user authentication and verification based on Union ID or SIN, which was critical for ensuring only eligible users could access job opportunities. Collaboration with Union Manager developers was also needed for integration and authorization.</p>
 
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A custom union dispatch system was developed in Drupal 7, enabling members to securely apply for jobs online. Integration with Local 488's Union Manager software synced user data automatically, while a cron job handled job posting imports and removals. Travel card and permit registration was integrated into the account creation process, with existing data migrated to user profiles. </p>
                                <p>A custom Drupal module was also created to refine job search filters, giving users more precise control over their job searches. Several administration tools and custom views were developed to support the administration of the ecosystem, streamlining workflows and providing dispatch staff with a more efficient tools to enhance overall operations.</p>

                                <h3>Google Ads PPC Management and Integrated Reporting</h3>
                                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Portage College sought to expand its online course offerings and increase enrollment in underperforming programs. While they had previously run PPC ads, they lacked a system to track lead form conversions and measure ROI effectively.</p>
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To bypass limitations with the college's proprietary CMS, Unbounce landing pages were introduced for rapid development. This led to a significant increase in lead form submissions. Two Google Tag Manager containers were set up: one for the main site and another for Unbounce pages. They were configured to track conversions and key user interactions. Goals were synced to Google Analytics and imported into Google Ads for Smart Bidding optimization.</p>               
                                <p>Comprehensive keyword research informed targeted copy and dynamic ads. This improved relevance, boosted quality scores which reduced CPC and increased the colleges CTR dramatically. Custom landing pages tailored to each program streamlined student inquiries. Ensured resources were effectively targeted by assisting with budgeting and strategically allocating spend to capture relevant traffic. A Looker Studio reporting solution integrated multiple data sources to support informed decision-making for the college's marketing team. Detailed documentation was created to guide future ad content creation and campaign management.</p>

                                <h3>Job Application Portal and Website Redesign</h3>
                                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Chemco's website needed updating to align with new branding and improve the job application process.</p>
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a WordPress Multisite with a custom career portal and dynamic form solution for job applications.</p>

                                <h4>Chemco</h4>
                                <h3>Job Application Portal and Website Redesign</h3>
                                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Chemco's previous website did not align with their updated corporate branding and lacked emphasis on their community, environmental, and employee growth initiatives. Career advertising was manually updated, leading to inefficiencies and technical debt, while different employment areas required unique application forms, which complicated the job posting process.</p>
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A new WordPress Multisite was created for Chemco and its affiliate organizations, aligning visually with Chemco's updated branding while highlighting their key values. The career portal solution was implemented across all properties within the multisite network. A dedicated content type for career postings was developed, along with a career portal featuring a dynamic filter for active job listings, making it easy for users to search and apply for opportunities online. A dynamic form solution was integrated, allowing post authors to select relevant forms and recipients based on the employment area, simplifying the application process. Additionally, social media sharing was streamlined, with open graph metadata automatically generated for platforms like Facebook and Twitter, enabling seamless sharing through a simple URL paste without the need for extra content creation.</p>
